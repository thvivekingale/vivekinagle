"I Didn't Join College for CGPA. I Joined for Me."

To be brutally honest — I didn’t join college because I believed in the education system. Because I don’t.

Most of what it teaches is outdated. Still stuck in an industrial-age loop, it rewards rote learning, not reasoning. It praises obedience, not originality. You memorize PowerPoint slides, ace a few exams, and earn a CGPA — a number that’s supposed to define your intelligence, your capability, your future. But it doesn't. Not even close.

The truth?
📉 The system is disconnected from reality. It doesn't teach you how to think, how to adapt, how to question. It teaches you how to conform.
🔄 We’re trained to follow orders, not to lead.
📚 We’re tested on memory, not mastery.
💼 We’re told a job is the end goal, not a tool for a larger life mission.

It’s not just a broken system — it’s a trap. A well-designed one.


---

🧠 The System Was Never Built For Learning. It Was Built for Obedience.

As exposed in the powerful documentary "The Education Trap", today’s education system is a relic of the Prussian model — built in the 1800s to create obedient soldiers and factory workers. Not creators. Not thinkers. Not leaders.

> “The goal wasn't to help you succeed. It was to shape you into someone who never questions orders.”



During the Industrial Revolution, when factories needed compliant workers, education was weaponized to suppress creativity. And sadly, most schools and colleges still follow that blueprint. That’s why students who once brimmed with curiosity end up stressed, anxious, and directionless. They aren't failing — the system is failing them.


---

📜 A Degree — Just a Piece of Paper?

And yet, I’m here. Why?

Because in today’s world, that piece of paper — the degree — still opens doors. Not because it means I’ve learned something meaningful, but because society still treats it as a validation stamp. Employers, families, systems — they all use degrees and CGPA as easy filters.

So yes, I came. But not for the lectures. Not for the outdated syllabi.
I came to make college work for me, on my terms.


---

🧩 CGPA ≠ Capability: Why It’s Failing Us

Let’s stop pretending a high CGPA guarantees anything.

Most engineers in India are still jobless even with 8+ CGPAs.

CGPA rewards test-taking ability, not real-world problem-solving.

It's possible to memorize your way to a 9-pointer while learning nothing of substance.


Meanwhile, hiring is changing.
🚀 Companies like Google, IBM, Tesla, and even startups across the globe no longer require a degree. They look for skills, portfolios, and proof of work — not what your mark sheet says.
💻 A GitHub profile or a Kaggle leaderboard rank says more about an engineer today than a CGPA ever can.
💼 AI tools are replacing résumés with automated skill assessments and project reviews.

The system isn’t just outdated — it’s irrelevant to the jobs of the future.


---

💡 I’m Not Just Studying — I’m Growing.

Even though I don’t believe in the academic system, I’ve decided to make the most of my time here. I’m not here to just pass exams — I’m here to evolve.

🔹 Soft Skills That Actually Matter

Through group projects, presentations, and countless peer interactions, I’m learning how to:

Communicate with clarity

Lead with confidence

Solve problems creatively

Work in diverse teams


These aren’t taught on the blackboard — but they’re what real employers are actually looking for.

🔹 Extracurriculars Over Electives

From organizing college fests to participating in national competitions, I’ve faced challenges no textbook ever prepared me for.
I’ve learned to:

Handle high-pressure situations

Manage resources and time

Think on my feet and bounce back from failure


That’s where the real education happens — outside the classroom.

🔹 Self-Discipline & Time Mastery

Balancing academics, side projects, internships, relationships, and personal goals has taught me more about life and consistency than any lecture.
I’ve built habits, found my rhythm, and learned to keep moving — no matter what.

🔹 Network > Notes

The most valuable thing I’ll take from college?
Connections.
The mentors I’ve met, the friends I’ve made, the alumni I’ve spoken with — they’ve opened more doors than CGPA ever could.


---

💥 We Were Promised Opportunities. We Got Obedience.

The education system told us:

> “Study hard, get good marks, and your life will be set.”



But reality says otherwise:

Even IITians are struggling to get placed today.

Students are drowning in debt, anxiety, and career confusion.

We invest 5+ years and lakhs of rupees, only to discover that the system was never built to help us thrive.


So why do we keep pretending this is normal?


---

🚪 Time to Break the Trap

We’re the generation that can break the mold.
We don’t have to wait to be chosen. We can choose ourselves.

Learn from the internet.

Build real-world skills.

Network smartly.

Think independently.

Explore without fear.


> "I didn’t join college to chase a CGPA. I came to hack the system, level up on my own terms, and build a future that grades could never measure."




---

🔮 The Future Doesn’t Belong to the Most Educated. It Belongs to the Most Equipped.

The world is changing fast — AI, automation, remote work, creator economy — and CGPA is not the currency of the future.
Skills. Grit. Network. Mindset. Execution. That’s the new gold standard.

So, no — I don’t believe in the system.
But I believe in myself.
And I’m using this system not to conform — but to transform.
